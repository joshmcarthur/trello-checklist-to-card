Trello Checklist to Card
===

A very simple JS app to turn a [Trello](http://trello.com) checklist into it's own card. The card is created by default with the name of the checklist (but you can change it on the page), and has the original checklist inserted onto the card.

If you want to improve it or customize it for your own use, you can just fork and clone it - I use coffeescript though, so be sure to run `coffee -o js -cw src` to build your coffeescript as you go.

Have fun!
